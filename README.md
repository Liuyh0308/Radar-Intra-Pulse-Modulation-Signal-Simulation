# Radar-Intra-Pulse-Modulation-Signal-Simulation

1. If you want to get the radar in-pulse modulation signal simulation dataset, run the cdwtfi_data_generation code and use the WVD time-frequency transform to generate a 2D time-frequency plot, and at the same time save the signal sequence of the radar in-pulse modulation signal as a mat format file as well。
2. If you just want to generate a sequence of radar signals and save them, run mat_data_gen. mat_data_gen_5pathdelay is a signal simulation environment that incorporates time delays and other factors.
3. Make sure you download the “tftb” signal time-frequency analysis toolkit and introduce the path to your MATLAB before running the code.
